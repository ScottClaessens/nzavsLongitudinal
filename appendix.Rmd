## Supplementary Methods

### Procedure for economic game sessions

In both waves, participants were booked into sessions on midweek evenings and 
completed the session online in real-time. Session sizes varied between 14 and 
130 participants. Although participants knew they were completing the study with 
other participants from the New Zealand Attitudes and Values Study, they did not
know specifically who they were interacting with in the session or how many 
other people there were in the session.

Participants completed a consent form before proceeding to the eight 
behavioural tasks (three cooperation games described in the main text, plus 
additional tasks). In the first wave, all eight tasks were completed in a 
randomised order. In the second wave, the economic games shared with the first
wave were completed first in a randomised order, followed by two new tasks (the
rule following and social information use tasks) which were presented in a 
separately randomised order. For each task, participants read the instructions 
for the task, completed a comprehension question, and then proceeded to make 
their decisions.

After making their decisions for all the tasks, participants entered a waiting 
lobby in which they waited for all other participants in their session to 
complete the tasks. If participants took longer than 55 minutes to complete the 
tasks, they were skipped ahead to the waiting lobby. Timeouts were still paid 
their show-up fee, but not their bonus. In the first wave, participants took 
`r printnum(mean(d$egame.SecsAll.T10 / 60), digits = 0)` minutes on average to 
complete all eight tasks (SD = 
`r printnum(sd(d$egame.SecsAll.T10 / 60), digits = 0)` minutes, range = 
`r printnum(min(d$egame.SecsAll.T10 / 60), digits = 0)` - 
`r printnum(max(d$egame.SecsAll.T10 / 60), digits = 0)` 
minutes), and in the second wave, participants took 
`r printnum(mean(d$egame.SecsAll.T11 / 60), digits = 0)` 
minutes on average (SD = `r printnum(sd(d$egame.SecsAll.T11 / 60), digits = 0)` 
minutes, range = `r printnum(min(d$egame.SecsAll.T11 / 60), digits = 0)` - 
`r printnum(max(d$egame.SecsAll.T11 / 60), digits = 0)` minutes).

## Supplementary Results

### Measurement invariance results

We tested for measurement invariance of the cooperative phenotype factor 
structure in a series of increasingly restrictive nested models. For all model 
comparisons, we pre-registered the use of changes in fit statistics as 
thresholds for diagnosing reduced model fit 
[$\Delta$Comparative Fit Index (CFI) < -0.01, $\Delta$Root Mean Square Error of 
Approximation (RMSEA) > 0.015] rather than $\chi^2$ differences which are 
sensitive to large sample sizes. To deal with non-independence of observations, 
all measurement invariance models had correlated item errors across waves.

First, we fitted a configural invariance model, which freely estimated the two 
latent variables simultaneously (Supplementary Table \@ref(tab:tableCompareMI)). 
As expected, this configural invariance model fitted the data well (CFI = 
`r printnum(fitMeasures(configMI)['cfi'])`, RMSEA = 
`r printnum(fitMeasures(configMI)['rmsea'])`) and all loadings were 
significantly positive. Second, we fitted a metric invariance model, which 
constrained the item loadings to equality across the two waves. Model fit did 
not substantially change ($\Delta$CFI = 
`r printnum(fitMeasures(metricMI)['cfi'] - fitMeasures(configMI)['cfi'], digits = 3)`, 
$\Delta$RMSEA = 
`r printnum(fitMeasures(metricMI)['rmsea'] - fitMeasures(configMI)['rmsea'], digits = 3)`). 
Third, we fitted a scalar invariance model, which constrained the item 
loadings, intercepts, and thresholds to equality across the two waves. Again, 
model fit did not substantially change ($\Delta$CFI = 
`r printnum(fitMeasures(scalarMI)['cfi'] - fitMeasures(metricMI)['cfi'], digits = 3)`, 
$\Delta$RMSEA = 
`r printnum(fitMeasures(scalarMI)['rmsea'] - fitMeasures(metricMI)['rmsea'], digits = 3)`).
Fourth, and finally, we fitted a strict invariance model, which constrained the 
item loadings, intercepts, thresholds, and variances to equality across waves. 
Model fit remained unchanged ($\Delta$CFI = 
`r printnum(fitMeasures(strictMI)['cfi'] - fitMeasures(scalarMI)['cfi'], digits = 3)`,
$\Delta$RMSEA = 
`r printnum(fitMeasures(strictMI)['rmsea'] - fitMeasures(scalarMI)['rmsea'], digits = 3)`).
Measurement invariance analysis thus supports strict invariance of the 
cooperative phenotype latent variable over time.
