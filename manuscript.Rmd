abstract: |
 Cross-sectional research has identified robust correlations between prosocial behaviour in economic games and political views, but this research is limited in its ability to draw causal inferences. Here, we conducted a longitudinal cross-lagged panel study of prosociality and political views with a New Zealand sample (n = 631). Across two waves separated by eighteen months, we measured self-reported political views and employed a battery of economic games to estimate people's general preferences for prosociality. We found that this "prosocial phenotype" predicted future variation in some of our measures of political views, including Social Dominance Orientation and support for income redistribution. Income attribution beliefs and political party support were not consistently related to the prosocial phenotype over time. None of these variables predicted future variation in the prosocial phenotype. These results suggest that prosocial predispositions may play a causal role in the expression of certain political views.

# Introduction

People vary in their political voting patterns, policy views, and party 
support. In part, this variation is thought to be due to individual differences
in political ideology, defined as "a set of stable, interrelated beliefs and 
attitudes that organise views on political and social issues" [@Jost2009].

It has long been assumed that one's ideology is primarily acquired through 
partisanship that is learned from one's parents and peers or soaked up through 
mass media [@Campbell1960;@Zaller1992]. This assumption continues today, with 
researchers arguing that differing political views are due mainly to partisan 
divides rather than any enduring psychological or dispositional differences 
[@Brandt2014]. However, this claim is at odds with research highlighting the 
importance of dispositional variables in the expression of political ideology. 
This body of work has revealed that, compared to liberals, conservatives tend to
be more sensitive to threats and uncertainty and express a greater need for 
closure [@Jost2003]. Different variables have also been linked to different 
measures of political ideology. Social conservatives and people higher in Right 
Wing Authoritarianism (RWA; an ideological measure of norm-adherence and group 
conformity) [@Altemeyer1981] tend to be more sensitive to disgusting stimuli 
[@Inbar2012], while economic conservatives and people higher in Social Dominance
Orientation (SDO; an ideological measure of support for hierarchy and dominance) 
[@Pratto1994] tend to exhibit higher levels of physical dominance and 
formidability [@Petersen2019].

Prosocial preferences have also been shown to vary across the ideological 
landscape. Research has found a negative relationship between SDO and 
Social Value Orientation (SVO), an other-regarding preference for allocating 
resources to others [@Chirumbolo2016;@Haesevoets2015]. Research has also 
revealed robust correlations between political views and prosocial behaviour in 
economic games. Economic games (_i.e._, social decision-making tasks that 
involve real money) are tools that elicit prosocial preferences such as
trust, cooperation, and reciprocity while avoiding the desirability issues that 
plague self-report methods [@Pisor2020]. Studies using economic games have shown
that people higher in SDO tend to share less money in social dilemma games that 
pit self-interest against collective-interest [@Haesevoets2015; @Haesevoets2018; 
@Halali2018]. A recent meta-analysis of data from over 3,000 participants found
a reliable negative correlation between SDO and prosocial behaviour in economic
games, albeit with a small effect size [@Thielmann2020].

Extending this work, @Claessens2023 found that SDO was negatively correlated 
with a general behavioural disposition for prosociality that is uncovered via a 
battery of economic games [@Peysakhovich2014]. These economic games included
the Trust Game, Dictator Game, and Public Goods Game. Although different
motivations underlie behaviour in these games, such as cooperation, altruism,
and fairness, prosocial behaviour in all of these games reflects a concern for 
the welfare of others when there is a possibility for exploitation 
[@Thielmann2022]. The common factor underlying prosocial behaviour in these 
economic games, referred to here as the "prosocial phenotype", has been 
replicated across a wide variety of samples and cultures [@Chierchia2017; 
@Peysakhovich2014; @Reigstad2017; @Yamagishi2013].

The correlation between political views and the prosocial phenotype provides
further evidence for a dispositional basis for political ideology. However, this 
correlation raises the question of whether and how these variables causally 
influence one another. At least three causal models are compatible with a 
cross-sectional correlation between political views and the prosocial 
phenotype.

Prior work has tended to adopt a _prosociality-as-outcome_ model. Under this 
model, biological and environmental factors interact to produce political 
views [@Duckitt2009] and people's political views then influence how they 
behave in economic games. This causal model is often assumed _a priori_ to 
explain cross-sectional correlations between politics and behaviour in economic
games. For example, @Grunhage2020 write that "political orientation 
_predisposes for_ a more trusting or cooperative behavior" (italics added; p. 22).

Alternatively, under the _prosociality-as-antecedent_ model, biological and 
environmental factors interact to produce the behavioural predispositions 
captured by economic games, and these behavioural predispositions influence the 
expression of particular political views. This causal model is predicted by the 
dual evolutionary framework of political ideology [@Claessens2020], which 
explains political attitudes as shaped in part by basic social drives that were
favoured during human evolution. Human group living evolved via two key shifts 
[@Tomasello2012]; a shift towards increased cooperation with others, and a shift 
towards conformity to and enforcement of group-wide social norms. According to 
the dual evolutionary framework, variation in general drives for cooperation and 
group conformity arises from the interaction between heritable individual 
differences and socio-ecological environments. These general drives for 
cooperation and group conformity, together with individuals' immediate social 
context, produce variation in two dimensions of political ideology, often 
referred to as economic and social ideology [@Claessens2020]. This causal 
pathway --- from behavioural predispositions to politics --- is captured by 
@VanLange2012, who write that "political preferences and voting are _partially 
rooted in_ interpersonal orientations" (italics added; p. 469).

Finally, the _common-cause_ model predicts that both behaviour and political 
views are caused by the same biological and environmental factors, but do not 
directly influence one another over time. This model is inspired by recent 
longitudinal evidence showing that personality does not causally precede 
political ideology, but instead personality and political ideology develop 
together in parallel, likely due to common causes from biological and 
environmental factors [@Osborne2020]. Similarly, the common-cause model predicts
that political ideology and the prosocial phenotype will be correlated, not 
because they influence one another over time, but because they share the same 
biological and environmental causes. This model is also consistent with the dual
evolutionary framework of political ideology, insofar as heritable individual
differences and socio-ecological environments influence both prosocial
behaviour and political ideology simultaneously.

Figure \@ref(fig:theoreticalModels) provides an overview of these causal 
models. All three models predict a cross-sectional correlation between political
ideology and prosocial behaviour. As such, previous cross-sectional work
cannot distinguish between them. Previous longitudinal work has shown that 
prosocial dispositions predict voting outcomes four weeks and eight months 
later [@VanLange2012] but, without concurrent measures of political views, this 
result is unable to directly support the prosociality-as-antecedent model.

(ref:theoreticalModelsFigCaption) At least three theoretical causal models are 
compatible with the cross-sectional correlation between political views and 
the prosocial phenotype.

```{r theoreticalModels, echo=F, fig.cap = "(ref:theoreticalModelsFigCaption)", out.width = "\\textwidth"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/theoreticalModels.png")
```

Longitudinal panel data allow us to generate specific hypotheses. If the 
prosociality-as-outcome model is correct, then political views at time _t_ 
should predict the prosocial phenotype at time _t + 1_, but the prosocial 
phenotype at time _t_ should be unrelated to political views at time _t + 1_. 
If the prosociality-as-antecedent model is correct, the opposite should be true:
the prosocial phenotype at time _t_ should predict political views at time 
_t + 1_, but political views at time _t_ should be unrelated to the prosocial
phenotype at time _t + 1_. We further test whether a common cause is generating
the observed relationships by controlling for a wide range of plausible
demographic and personality confounds.

Here, we test between different causal hypotheses using a pre-registered 
cross-lagged longitudinal panel design with two time-points separated by 
eighteen months. We estimate the directions of causality between the prosocial 
phenotype and several political views, including Social Dominance Orientation, 
views on economic issues, and political party support.

# Methods

## Ethical approval

Ethical approval was granted by REDACTED (ref: 021666). The study was performed 
in accordance with all the relevant guidelines and regulations. Participation 
was voluntary and informed consent was obtained from all participants prior to 
the study.

## Participants and sampling

```{r echo=F}
tar_load(d)
```

Participants were sampled from the New Zealand Attitudes and Values Study 
(NZAVS), an annual longitudinal self-report study that has been active since 
2009. 1045 participants took part in the first wave of economic game data 
collection, were successfully paid for the study, and did not time out
of their session. In the second wave, this sample size dropped to 631 
(60% retention rate). We only analysed data from participants who completed 
both waves (n = `r nrow(d)`; 
`r printnum(sum(d$Gender.T10 == 0, na.rm = T))` females; mean age = 
`r printnum(mean(d$Age.T10, na.rm = T), digits = 0)` years; age range = 
`r printnum(min(d$Age.T10, na.rm = T), digits = 0)` - 
`r printnum(max(d$Age.T10, na.rm = T), digits = 0)` years). This sample size was 
the largest available to us and was not determined through a formal power 
analysis. These data are the same as used in our previous work
[@Claessens2022; @Claessens2023].

## Materials

### Self-report measures

Main self-report measures were taken from Waves 10 and 11 of the NZAVS. The 
primary measures of interest for this study were: Social Dominance Orientation 
[@Pratto1994]; support for income redistribution ("redistributing money and 
wealth more evenly among a larger percentage of the people in New Zealand 
through heavy taxes on the rich"); income attribution ("if incomes were more 
equal, people would be less motivated to work hard"); and support for New 
Zealand's centre-right National Party. We chose these measures because they all 
exhibited cross-sectional correlations with economic game behaviour in 
previous research [@Claessens2023].

Other time-invariant covariates that could plausibly act as confounding 
variables were taken from Wave 10 of the NZAVS (Supplementary Table 
\@ref(tab:itemTable)). These included socio-demographic variables (age, gender,
ethnicity, education, measures of local deprivation, socio-economic status, and
religiosity), personality variables (extraversion, agreeableness, 
conscientiousness, neuroticism, openness-to-experience, honesty-humility, and 
narcissism) [@Sibley2011] and Right Wing Authoritarianism [@Altemeyer1981]. We
do not include RWA as a primary measure of interest in this study because our
theoretical framework does not predict a longitudinal (or cross-sectional) 
relationship between authoritarian ideology and the prosocial phenotype 
[@Claessens2020]. Consistent with this, a prior analysis found no 
cross-sectional relationship between these variables [@Claessens2023].

### Battery of economic games

Participants completed several incentivised one-shot economic games, conducted 
online in real-time using oTree [@Chen2016]. These games measure prosocial 
behaviour and are largely identical to the games used in @Peysakhovich2014. We
used the strategy method to elicit responses in all roles. Participants played 
for points, which were converted to New Zealand dollars (1 point = $0.035).

The games measuring prosociality (paying a cost to benefit others) in our 
pre-registered analyses are as follows:

- _Dictator Game_. Player A is given 100 points. They must decide how many of 
  these points to transfer to Player B. Player A keeps the remaining points.
  Player B is passive in the interaction.
- _Trust Game_. Players A and B both start with 50 points. First, Player A 
  decides whether or not to transfer all 50 points to Player B, in the 
  knowledge that the transferred amount will be tripled to 150 points. If 
  Player A transfers, Player B now has 200 points. Player B must then decide to 
  transfer 0 - 150 points back to Player A. There are thus two decisions in 
  this game: giving and returning.
- _Public Goods Game_. Four players begin with 100 points each. They can 
  contribute 0 - 100 points into a shared group project. All four decisions are 
  made simultaneously, and then the amount in the group project is doubled and 
  distributed evenly between all four players. Each player ends the game with 
  their share from the group project, plus the points they initially refrained 
  from contributing.
  
In further analyses that were not pre-registered, we tested the generalisability
of our results by also including games where prosocial behaviour was elicited 
under the threat of future punishment (the Ultimatum Game and Second-Party
Punishment Game). See Supplementary Methods for game descriptions and further 
details.

## Procedure

The NZAVS collects self-report data both online and via paper surveys. In Wave 
10 of the study, most of the data were collected between November 2018 and 
September 2019, and in Wave 11 of the study, most of the data were collected 
between October 2019 and November 2020. Data collection for the first wave of 
economic games was conducted between 18^th^ February and 25^th^ July 2019, and 
data collection for the second wave was conducted between 19^th^ October and 
11^th^ November 2020 (Supplementary Figure \@ref(fig:timelinePlot)).

Economic game sessions were conducted in real-time on midweek evenings, during 
which the games were completed in a randomised order. Participants were paid a 
\$20 NZD show-up fee, plus their bonus payment. In the first wave, participants 
earned a bonus payment of \$`r printnum(mean(d$egame.Paid.T10 - 20))` on average (SD = \$`r printnum(sd(d$egame.Paid.T10 - 20))`). In the second wave, 
participants earned a bonus payment of 
\$`r printnum(mean(d$egame.Paid.T11 - 20))` on average (SD = 
\$`r printnum(sd(d$egame.Paid.T11 - 20))`).

## Pre-registration

We pre-registered our hypotheses on the Open Science Framework 
(https://osf.io/ksw3x/?view_only=597d9d552bc142f4a6d59e4eba97b425) before 
running the second wave of economic game data collection. We deviated from our 
pre-registration in our interpretation of a lack of cross-lagged effects. In the 
pre-registration, we stated that a lack of cross-lagged effects, along with the 
presence of within-wave correlations, would support the common-cause model in 
Figure \@ref(fig:theoreticalModels). However, an anonymous reviewer pointed out 
that this is not necessarily true, especially if potential common causes are not 
statistically controlled for. We no longer make this statistical inference, but 
test several versions of the common cause model by systematically controlling 
for a range of potential confounds, including demographic and personality 
variables.

## Statistical analysis

We used confirmatory factor analysis and structural equation modelling to test 
our pre-registered hypotheses. For measurement invariance analyses, we fitted a 
confirmatory factor analysis model with correlated item errors across waves to 
deal with non-independence of observations. For our longitudinal modelling, we 
used two-wave two-variable cross-lagged panel models.

```{r}
propComplete <- 
  (dplyr::select(d, Age.T10, Gender.T10, EthnicCats.T10, NZREG.T10, 
                 NZSEI13.T10, NZDep.2013.T10, Religious.T10, T10.RWA, 
                 T10.SDO, T11.SDO, Issue.IncomeRedistribution.T10, 
                 Issue.IncomeRedistribution.T11, IncomeAttribution.T10, 
                 IncomeAttribution.T11, Pol.SupNational.T10, 
                 Pol.SupNational.T11, egame.TG1.T10, egame.TG1.T11, 
                 egame.TG2.T10, egame.TG2.T11, egame.PGG.T10, egame.PGG.T11, 
                 egame.DG.T10, egame.DG.T11, egame.UG1.T10, egame.UG1.T11,
                 egame.SPP1.T10, egame.SPP1.T11) %>% 
     drop_na() %>% 
     nrow()
   ) / nrow(d)
```

`r printnum(propComplete * 100, digits = 0)`% of participants had complete data
for all variables (see Supplementary Figure \@ref(fig:plotObs)). To deal with 
missing data, we used multiple imputation with predictive mean matching 
[@R-mice]. Multiple imputation procedures generate a number of plausible 
complete datasets with imputed missing values. Statistical models are then
fitted to all imputed datasets and results are pooled across models to account
for uncertainty in imputed values. We followed the advice of imputing at least
as many datasets as the percentage of cases that are incomplete 
[@vonHippel2009]. We therefore pooled our estimates across 20 imputed datasets. 
Visual inspection confirmed the plausibility of imputed values (see 
Supplementary Figure \@ref(fig:impPlot)). Results for all pre-registered models 
were unchanged when using listwise deletion (see Supplementary Material).

## Transparency and openness

The consent form for the NZAVS states that data will only be shared with other 
researchers on a case-by-case basis for the purposes of checking published work.
For this reason, ethical concerns prevent us from making the dataset from this 
study publicly available. However, data are available on request from the lead
author.

Pre-registration, analysis plan, R code for analyses, and Python code for the 
economic games are available at 
https://osf.io/ksw3x/?view_only=597d9d552bc142f4a6d59e4eba97b425. All analyses 
were conducted in R version 4.2.1 [@R-base] using the _lavaan_ package 
[@R-lavaan]. Figures were created using _ggraph_ [@R-ggraph], _cowplot_ 
[@R-cowplot], and _ggplot2_ [@R-ggplot2] packages, multiple imputation was 
implemented using the _mice_ package [@R-mice], reproducibility of all analyses 
was ensured by using the _targets_ package [@R-targets], and the manuscript was 
generated using the _papaja_ package [@R-papaja].

# Results

```{r echo=F, message=F, warning=F, results="hide"}
tar_load(cfa_Reduced)
tar_load(sem1_Reduced)
s <- data.frame(summary(sem1_Reduced, ci = TRUE))
```

In the first step of our pre-registered analyses, we focused on the 
second wave of data in order to replicate our previous findings from the first 
wave [@Claessens2023]. First, we fitted a confirmatory factor analysis model 
with the Trust Game (Give), Trust Game (Return), Dictator Game, and Public 
Goods Game loading onto a "prosocial phenotype" latent variable. Supporting 
our pre-registered hypothesis, all factor loadings were significantly 
positive (_p_ < 0.05) and the model fitted the data well (CFI = 
`r printnum(as.numeric(fitMeasures(cfa_Reduced)['cfi']))`, RMSEA = 
`r printnum(as.numeric(fitMeasures(cfa_Reduced)['rmsea']))`, SRMR = 
`r printnum(as.numeric(fitMeasures(cfa_Reduced)['srmr']))`; Supplementary Figure 
\@ref(fig:cfaPlotReduced)) [@Hu1999; @MacCallum1996]. The games showed 
acceptable reliability in both the first wave ($\alpha$ = 
`r printnum(tar_read(reliability1_Reduced)$alpha)`, $\omega$ = 
`r printnum(tar_read(reliability1_Reduced)$omega.tot)`) and the second wave 
($\alpha$ = `r printnum(tar_read(reliability2_Reduced)$alpha)`, $\omega$ = 
`r printnum(tar_read(reliability2_Reduced)$omega.tot)`), and the zero-order 
correlations between games were all positive and small-to-medium in size 
(_r_ = 0.20 -- 0.37; Supplementary Figure \@ref(fig:plotCorsReduced)) supporting
the existence of a single latent construct. These results held when we included
prosocial behaviour in the Ultimatum Game and the Second-Party Punishment Game
(see Supplementary Results).

Second, we fitted a structural equation model with SDO as the sole predictor of 
the prosocial phenotype latent variable. Supporting our pre-registered 
hypothesis, we found that SDO significantly negatively predicted the prosocial 
phenotype (unstandardised _b_ = `r printnum(s[5,5])`, 95% confidence interval 
[`r printnum(s[5,10])` `r printnum(s[5,11])`], _p_ `r printp(s[5,9])`; 
Supplementary Figure \@ref(fig:semPlotReduced)). This result held when we 
included prosocial behaviour in the Ultimatum Game and the Second-Party 
Punishment Game (see Supplementary Results). Together, these findings replicate
our previous work with the same sample of participants eighteen months later 
[@Claessens2023].

```{r echo=F, message=F, warning=F, results="hide"}
tar_load(configMI_Reduced)
tar_load(metricMI_Reduced)
tar_load(scalarMI_Reduced)
tar_load(strictMI_Reduced)
```

In the next step of our pre-registered analyses, we tested the measurement 
invariance of the prosocial phenotype latent variable across the two waves. 
Longitudinal measurement invariance testing ensures that latent factor 
structures are stable over time, an important prerequisite to cross-lagged 
panel modelling. We found support for strict invariance of the prosocial
phenotype latent variable over time (see Supplementary Results) suggesting that 
the prosocial phenotype was measured with the same reliability over an
eighteen-month period. Moreover, the between-wave latent correlation from the 
strict invariance model (_r_ = 
`r printnum(standardizedSolution(strictMI_Reduced)[9,"est.std"])`, 95% CI
[`r printnum(standardizedSolution(strictMI_Reduced)[9,"ci.lower"])`
`r printnum(standardizedSolution(strictMI_Reduced)[9,"ci.upper"])`]) suggested 
that the prosocial phenotype exhibited good test-retest reliability over time. 
These results held when we included prosocial behaviour in the Ultimatum Game 
and the Second-Party Punishment Game (see Supplementary Results).

```{r echo=F, warning=F, message=F, results='hide'}
tar_load(clpm_1.01_dM_Reduced)
s <- as.data.frame(summary(clpm_1.01_dM_Reduced, ci = TRUE))
```

We then proceeded to fit our pre-registered two-variable two-wave cross-lagged 
panel models. We first fitted our primary cross-lagged panel model, modelling 
the relationship between SDO and the prosocial phenotype over time (Figure 
\@ref(fig:clpmPlotSDOdMReduced)a). We found significantly positive autoregressive 
effects: SDO in the first wave predicted SDO in the second wave (standardised 
$\beta$ = `r printnum(standardizedSolution(clpm_1.01_dM_Reduced)[34,5])`, 
unstandardised _b_ = `r printnum(s[34,5])`, 95% CI [`r printnum(s[34,10])` 
`r printnum(s[34,11])`], _p_ `r printp(s[34,9])`) and the prosocial phenotype 
in the first wave predicted the prosocial phenotype in the second wave 
($\beta$ = `r printnum(standardizedSolution(clpm_1.01_dM_Reduced)[31,5])`, _b_ = 
`r printnum(s[31,5])`, 95% CI [`r printnum(s[31,10])` `r printnum(s[31,11])`], 
_p_ `r printp(s[31,9])`). Additionally, we found that the prosocial phenotype 
in the first wave negatively predicted SDO in the second wave ($\beta$ = 
`r printnum(standardizedSolution(clpm_1.01_dM_Reduced)[33,5])`, _b_ = 
`r printnum(s[33,5])`, 95% CI [`r printnum(s[33,10])` `r printnum(s[33,11])`], 
_p_ = `r printp(s[33,9])`), but SDO in the first wave did not predict the 
prosocial phenotype in the second wave ($\beta$ 
= `r printnum(standardizedSolution(clpm_1.01_dM_Reduced)[32,5])`, _b_ = 
`r printnum(s[32,5])`, 95% CI [`r printnum(s[32,10])` `r printnum(s[32,11])`], 
_p_ = `r printp(s[32,9])`). These cross-lagged paths were significantly 
different from one another (difference in unstandardised estimates = 
`r printnum(s[47,5])`, 95% CI [`r printnum(s[47,10])` `r printnum(s[47,11])`], 
_p_ = `r printp(s[47,9])`). These results were unchanged when using listwise
deletion rather than multiple imputation (Supplementary Figure 
\@ref(fig:clpmPlotSDOdReduced)) and when including the Ultimatum Game and
Second-Party Punishment Game (see Supplementary Results).

According to @Adachi2015, even small cross-lagged effects in autoregressive 
models can be meaningful if the bivariate between-wave correlation is 
sufficiently large and the outcome variable is highly stable over time. Indeed,
we find that the bivariate correlation between the prosocial phenotype in the 
first wave and SDO in the second wave is medium in size (_r_ = 
`r printnum(standardizedSolution(tar_read(sem2_SDO_Reduced))[5,"est.std"])`) and 
SDO is highly stable over time ($\beta$ = 
`r printnum(standardizedSolution(clpm_1.01_dM_Reduced)[31,5])`), suggesting that
the cross-lagged effect of prosociality on future SDO is meaningful despite its
smaller size.

```{r echo=F, warning=F, message=F, results='hide'}
tar_load(clpmSplitGender_Reduced)
tar_load(clpmSplitEthnicity_Reduced)
s1 <- as.data.frame(summary(clpmSplitGender_Reduced, ci = TRUE))
s2 <- as.data.frame(summary(clpmSplitEthnicity_Reduced, ci = TRUE))
```

To test possible common-cause explanations for this pattern of results,
we ran additional cross-lagged panel models controlling for a range of 
time-invariant covariates that could plausibly act as confounds (Figures 
\@ref(fig:clpmPlotSDOdMReduced)b and \@ref(fig:clpmPlotSDOdMReduced)c; 
Supplementary Figures \@ref(fig:clpmPlotSDOdReduced)b and 
\@ref(fig:clpmPlotSDOdReduced)c). The cross-lagged path from the prosocial 
phenotype to later SDO remained significantly negative when controlling for most
demographic and personality variables, but was attenuated when controlling for 
gender and ethnicity. Given these results, we ran exploratory multi-group 
cross-lagged panel models with separate groups for (1) male and female 
participants, and (2) participants of European ancestry and participants not of
European ancestry (due to small sample sizes in individual Asian, Māori, and 
Pacific groups). These follow-up models revealed that the cross-lagged path from
the prosocial phenotype to later SDO was significantly negative for males 
($\beta$ = `r printnum(standardizedSolution(clpmSplitGender_Reduced)[79,6])`, 
_b_ = `r printnum(s1[79,7])`, 95% CI [`r printnum(s1[79,12])` 
`r printnum(s1[79,13])`], _p_ = `r printp(s1[79,11])`) but not for females 
($\beta$ = `r printnum(standardizedSolution(clpmSplitGender_Reduced)[33,6])`, 
_b_ = `r printnum(s1[33,7])`, 95% CI [`r printnum(s1[33,12])` 
`r printnum(s1[33,13])`], _p_ = `r printp(s1[33,11])`) though these were both 
in the same direction. Similarly, the cross-lagged path from the prosocial 
phenotype to later SDO was significantly negative for participants of European 
ancestry ($\beta$ = 
`r printnum(standardizedSolution(clpmSplitEthnicity_Reduced)[79,6])`, 
_b_ = `r printnum(s2[79,7])`, 95% CI [`r printnum(s2[79,12])` 
`r printnum(s2[79,13])`], _p_ = `r printp(s2[79,11])`) but not for other 
participants ($\beta$ = 
`r printnum(standardizedSolution(clpmSplitEthnicity_Reduced)[33,6])`, 
_b_ = `r printnum(s2[33,7])`, 95% CI [`r printnum(s2[33,12])` 
`r printnum(s2[33,13])`], _p_ = `r printp(s2[33,11])`) though these were both 
in the same direction.

We also collected data on other self-reported measures of political views, 
including views on income redistribution, income attribution, and support for 
the centre-right National Party. To assess the generalisability of our results, 
we swapped out SDO in our cross-lagged panel model for these additional 
measures.

When we included support for income redistribution in the model instead of SDO, 
we found a similar pattern of results: the prosocial phenotype positively 
predicted future support for income redistribution, but support for income 
redistribution did not predict future prosociality 
(Supplementary Figures \@ref(fig:clpmPlotIncReddMReduced) and 
\@ref(fig:clpmPlotIncReddReduced)). However, this pattern of results was 
attenuated when controlling for gender, ethnicity, religiosity, agreeableness, 
openness-to-experience, and honesty-humility, and when including the Ultimatum
Game and the Second-Party Punishment Game in the measurement model for the
prosocial phenotype (see Supplementary Results).

When we included income attribution views and support for New Zealand's 
centre-right National Party in the model instead of SDO, we initially found no 
cross-lagged effects over time (Supplementary Figures 
\@ref(fig:clpmPlotIncAttdMReduced) -- \@ref(fig:clpmPlotPolNatdReduced)). 
However, we found that the prosocial phenotype positively predicted future 
support for the National Party when including the Ultimatum Game and 
Second-Party Punishment Game in the measurement model for the prosocial 
phenotype (see Supplementary Results).

# Discussion

In a cross-lagged longitudinal analysis of prosocial behaviour and 
self-reported political attitudes, we have shown that the prosocial phenotype 
predicts SDO a year and a half later, but SDO does not predict future variation 
in the prosocial phenotype. This result is in line with the 
prosociality-as-antecedent model (Figure \@ref(fig:theoreticalModels)) which 
posits that general behavioural predispositions like the prosocial phenotype 
causally influence political views, but not vice versa. This causal model 
explains previously reported negative cross-sectional correlations between 
prosociality and SDO [@Haesevoets2015; @Halali2018; @Thielmann2020; 
@Claessens2023] as arising from a causal relationship from behavioural 
preferences to political views.

```{r echo=FALSE}
# calculate difference in SDO
d$SDOdiff <- d$T10.SDO - d$T11.SDO
# two groups
d$group <- ifelse(
  as.character(d$EthnicCats.T10) == "Pakeha" & d$Gender.T10 == 1, 
  "Pakeha males", "Others"
  )
d$group <- ifelse(!is.na(d$group), d$group, "Others")
# variance in sdo difference
varPakehaMales <- var(d$SDOdiff[d$group == "Pakeha males"], na.rm = TRUE)
varOthers <- var(d$SDOdiff[d$group == "Others"], na.rm = TRUE)
# levene's test
levene <- leveneTest(SDOdiff ~ factor(group), data = d)
```

Additionally, the cross-lagged path from prosociality to future SDO was robust 
to a wide range of time-invariant demographic and personality covariates. It is 
therefore unlikely that these variables are acting as common causes and 
generating the observed pattern of relationships (though, of course, it remains
possible that other unmodelled common causes could exist). However, the 
cross-lagged path from prosociality to future SDO was attenuated when controlling
for gender and ethnicity. In particular, exploratory analyses revealed that the
cross-lagged effect held only for male participants of European ancestry. This
is similar to the finding that upper body strength is related to support for
inequality in males, but not females [@Petersen2019]. A possible evolutionary
explanation for this effect of gender might be that humans have large sexual
dimorphism in strength and formidability and, therefore, a correlation between
the prosocial phenotype and dominative/competitive tactics for resource
distribution is more likely among males. But this does not explain the effect of
ethnicity. Perhaps a simpler explanation is that SDO is generally higher among
males and people from dominant ethnic groups [@Pratto1994; @Sidanius2000]. Among
these participants, there is potentially more room for a change in SDO over 
time, whereas female participants from minority ethnic groups may have already
hit the floor of the scale and therefore have less room for change. In line with
this explanation, when we look at the differences in SDO between the two waves,
we find that these difference scores have a higher variance for males of 
European ancestry (variance = `r round(varPakehaMales, 2)`) compared to other 
participants (variance = `r round(varOthers, 2)`; Levene's test, 
_F_(`r levene$Df[1]`,`r levene$Df[2]`) = `r printnum(levene[["F value"]][1])`, 
_p_ `r printp(levene[["Pr(>F)"]][1])`) suggesting that SDO had more room for 
change over time among males of European ancestry. Future research should 
disentangle the roles of gender and ethnicity in the causal relationship 
between behavioural predispositions and political views.

When we generalised our cross-lagged analysis to other political views, we found 
more mixed results. As expected, the prosocial phenotype positively predicted 
future support for income redistribution, though this effect was attenuated in 
some models. However, in our initial models, the prosocial phenotype was not 
longitudinally related to income attribution beliefs or support for New 
Zealand's centre-right National party. These null results could arise from a 
shared cause influencing these variables at the same time (i.e., the 
common-cause model in Figure \@ref(fig:theoreticalModels)) creating a 
cross-sectional relationship but no longitudinal effects. However, this pattern
of null results is also consistent with other explanations. For example, it may
be that party affiliation and income attribution beliefs are simply less 
amenable to change over time: people rarely shift their political party 
affiliation [@PewResearchCenter2020] and income attribution beliefs have 
been characterised as a stable individual difference [@Osborne2015; but see 
@Piff2020]. Alternatively, cross-lagged effects may exist between the 
prosocial phenotype and these variables but on longer or shorter timescales 
than studied here. It is therefore difficult to interpret these null results 
as supporting any particular causal model from Figure 
\@ref(fig:theoreticalModels). Moreover, although we found that the prosocial
phenotype positively predicted future support for the National Party when 
including the full set of games in the measurement model (Supplementary 
Results), this finding is also difficult to interpret given the negative 
bivariate correlation between these variables in the data (_r_ = 
`r printnum(standardizedSolution(tar_read(sem2_PolNat_Full))[7,"est.std"])`).

Nevertheless, our results for SDO and views on income redistribution are broadly
consistent with the dual evolutionary foundations framework for political 
ideology. The cross-lagged effects of the prosocial phenotype on these 
variables support either the prosociality-as-antecedent or common cause model, 
and none of our results directly support the causal model that is inconsistent 
with the dual evolutionary foundations (the prosociality-as-outcome model). 
Moreover, our measurement invariance analyses and the latent correlation from 
our strict invariance model revealed that the prosocial phenotype latent 
variable had adequate test-retest reliability over eighteen months, supporting 
another central claim from the dual evolutionary foundations framework that the 
general social drives that partly shape political ideology should be relatively 
stable over time. This finding expands on studies showing that prosocial 
behaviour in individual economic games positively covaries when measured over 
four months [@Peysakhovich2014; @Reigstad2017], one year [@Lonnqvist2015], and 
even six years [@Carlsson2014].

One important limitation of this study is our use of two-wave cross-lagged 
panel models to determine longitudinal effects. Cross-lagged panel models have 
been criticised for not correctly partitioning within-person change from stable 
between-person differences [@Hamaker2015]. As an alternative to the 
cross-lagged panel model, @Hamaker2015 proposed the random-intercept 
cross-lagged panel model, which estimates a random intercept to capture stable 
individual differences over time. Unfortunately, random-intercept cross-lagged
panel models require at least three waves of data to be identified
[@Hamaker2015] and so we were limited by our two waves of data in this study.
Moving forward, it will be vital to extend this study to include additional 
waves of behavioural and self-report data to determine if our results hold when
accounting for stable between-person differences.

Future research should expand our multi-wave behavioural and self-report 
approach to include additional measures. In particular, to provide a complete 
picture for the dual evolutionary foundations framework, future research should 
test whether a "group conformist phenotype" predicts future variation in RWA 
and social policy views [@Claessens2020]. We did not focus on RWA in the current
study as RWA is not theorised to be related to the prosocial phenotype. Instead,
our previous work suggests that RWA covaries cross-sectionally with conformist 
behaviour in the rule following task and social learning tasks [@Fischer2021; 
@Claessens2023]. Since these studies only measured conformist behaviour in 
single time slices, we were unable to extend this work longitudinally to make 
causal claims. Such longitudinal studies have the potential to unpack the causal 
pathways underlying the full diversity of human political ideology.
