abstract: |
 Cross-sectional research has identified robust correlations between cooperative behaviour in economic games and political views, but this research is limited in its ability to draw causal inferences. Here, we conducted a longitudinal cross-lagged panel study of cooperation and political views with a New Zealand sample (n = 631). Across two waves separated by eighteen months, we measured self-reported political views and employed a battery of economic games to estimate people's general preferences for cooperation. We found that this "cooperative phenotype" predicted future variation in some of our measures of political views, including Social Dominance Orientation and support for income redistribution. Income attribution beliefs and political party support were not related to the cooperative phenotype over time. None of these variables predicted future variation in the cooperative phenotype. These results suggest that cooperative predispositions may play a causal role in the expression of certain political views.

# Introduction

People vary in their political voting patterns, policy views, and party 
support. In part, this variation is thought to be due to individual differences
in political ideology, defined as "a set of stable, interrelated beliefs and 
attitudes that organise views on political and social issues" [@Jost2009].

It has long been assumed that one's ideology is primarily acquired through 
partisanship that is learned from one's parents and peers or soaked up through 
mass media [@Campbell1960;@Zaller1992]. This assumption continues today, with 
researchers arguing that differing political views are due mainly to partisan 
divides rather than any enduring psychological or dispositional differences 
[@Brandt2014]. However, this claim is at odds with research highlighting the 
importance of dispositional variables in the expression of political ideology. 
This body of work has revealed that, compared to liberals, conservatives tend to
be more sensitive to threats and uncertainty [@Jost2003] and express a greater 
need for closure [@Jost2003]. Different variables have also been linked to 
different measures of political ideology. Social conservatives and people higher
in Right Wing Authoritarianism (RWA; an ideological measure of norm-adherence 
and group conformity) [@Altemeyer1981] tend to be more sensitive to disgusting 
stimuli [@Inbar2012], while economic conservatives and people higher in Social 
Dominance Orientation (SDO; an ideological measure of support for hierarchy and
dominance) [@Pratto1994] tend to exhibit higher levels of physical dominance and 
formidability [@Petersen2019].

Prosocial preferences have also been shown to vary across the ideological 
landscape. Research has found a negative relationship between SDO and 
Social Value Orientation (SVO), a self-reported measure of prosocial preferences
in which people make hypothetical allocations of money between themselves and 
others [@Chirumbolo2016;@Haesevoets2015]. Research has also revealed robust 
correlations between political views and cooperative behaviour in economic 
games. Economic games (_i.e._, social decision-making tasks that involve real 
money) are tools that elicit prosocial preferences while avoiding the 
desirability issues that plague self-report methods [@Pisor2020]. Studies using
economic games have shown that people higher in SDO tend to share less money in
social dilemma games that pit self-interest against collective-interest 
[@Haesevoets2015; @Haesevoets2018; @Halali2018]. A recent meta-analysis of data 
from over 3,000 participants found a reliable negative correlation between SDO 
and cooperative behaviour in economic games, albeit with a small effect size 
[@Thielmann2020].

Extending this work, @Claessens2023 found that SDO was negatively correlated 
with a "cooperative phenotype" latent variable, a general behavioural 
disposition for cooperation that is uncovered via a battery of economic games 
[@Peysakhovich2014]. Conceptually similar to SVO but measured across a variety 
of incentivised contexts, the cooperative phenotype reflects an unconditional 
concern for the welfare of others when there is a possibility for exploitation 
[@Thielmann2022]. This common factor underlying prosocial behaviour in economic 
games has been replicated across a wide variety of samples and cultures 
[@Chierchia2017; @Claessens2023; @Peysakhovich2014; @Reigstad2017; 
@Yamagishi2013].

The correlation between political views and the cooperative phenotype provides
further evidence for a dispositional basis for political ideology. However, this 
correlation raises the question of whether and how these variables causally 
influence one another. At least three causal models are compatible with a 
cross-sectional correlation between political views and the cooperative 
phenotype.

Prior work has tended to adopt a _cooperation-as-outcome_ model. Under this 
model, biological and environmental factors interact to produce political 
views [@Duckitt2009] and people's political views then influence how they 
behave in economic games. This causal model is often assumed _a priori_ to 
explain cross-sectional correlations between politics and behaviour in economic
games. For example, @Grunhage2020 write that "political orientation 
_predisposes for_ a more trusting or cooperative behavior" (italics added; p. 22).

Alternatively, under the _cooperation-as-antecedent_ model, biological and 
environmental factors interact to produce the behavioural predispositions 
captured by economic games, and these behavioural predispositions influence the 
expression of particular political views. This causal model is predicted by the 
dual evolutionary framework of political ideology [@Claessens2020], which 
explains political attitudes as shaped in part by basic social drives that were
favoured during human evolution. Human group living evolved via two key shifts 
[@Tomasello2012]; a shift towards increased cooperation with others, and a shift 
towards conformity to and enforcement of group-wide social norms. According to 
the dual evolutionary framework, variation in general drives for cooperation and 
group conformity arises from the interaction between heritable individual 
differences and socio-ecological environments. These general drives for 
cooperation and group conformity, together with individuals' immediate social 
context, produce variation in two dimensions of political ideology, often 
referred to as economic and social ideology [@Claessens2020]. This causal 
pathway --- from behavioural predispositions to politics --- is captured by 
@VanLange2012, who write that "political preferences and voting are _partially 
rooted in_ interpersonal orientations" (italics added; p. 469).

Finally, the _common-cause_ model predicts that both behaviour and political 
views are caused by the same biological and environmental factors, but do not 
directly influence one another over time. This model is inspired by recent 
longitudinal evidence showing that personality does not causally precede 
political ideology, but instead personality and political ideology develop 
together in parallel, likely due to common causes from biological and 
environmental factors [@Osborne2020]. Similarly, the common-cause model predicts
that political ideology and the cooperative phenotype will be correlated, not 
because they influence one another over time, but because they share the same 
biological and environmental causes. This model is also consistent with the dual
evolutionary framework of political ideology, insofar as heritable individual
differences and socio-ecological environments influence both cooperative
behaviour and political ideology simultaneously.

Figure \@ref(fig:theoreticalModels) provides an overview of these causal 
models. All three models predict a cross-sectional correlation between political
ideology and cooperative behaviour. As such, previous cross-sectional work
cannot distinguish between them. Previous longitudinal work has shown that 
cooperative dispositions predict voting outcomes four weeks and eight months 
later [@VanLange2012] but, without concurrent measures of political views, this 
result is unable to directly support the cooperation-as-antecedent model.

(ref:theoreticalModelsFigCaption) At least three theoretical causal models are 
compatible with the cross-sectional correlation between political views and 
the cooperative phenotype.

```{r theoreticalModels, echo=F, fig.cap = "(ref:theoreticalModelsFigCaption)", out.width = "\\textwidth"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/theoreticalModels.png")
```

Longitudinal panel data allow us to generate specific hypotheses. If the 
cooperation-as-outcome model is correct, then political views at time _t_ should
predict the cooperative phenotype at time _t + 1_, but the cooperative phenotype
at time _t_ should be unrelated to political views at time _t + 1_. If the
cooperation-as-antecedent model is correct, the opposite should be true: the 
cooperative phenotype at time _t_ should predict political views at time 
_t + 1_, but political views at time _t_ should be unrelated to the cooperative
phenotype at time _t + 1_. We further test whether a common cause is generating
the observed relationships by controlling for a wide range of plausible
demographic and personality confounds.

Here, we test between different causal hypotheses using a pre-registered 
cross-lagged longitudinal panel design with two time-points separated by 
eighteen months. We estimate the directions of causality between the cooperative 
phenotype and several political views, including Social Dominance Orientation, 
views on economic issues, and political party support.

# Methods

## Ethical approval

Ethical approval was granted by REDACTED (ref: 021666). The study was performed 
in accordance with all the relevant guidelines and regulations. Participation 
was voluntary and informed consent was obtained from all participants prior to 
the study.

## Participants and sampling

```{r echo=F}
tar_load(d)
```

Participants were sampled from the New Zealand Attitudes and Values Study 
(NZAVS), an annual longitudinal self-report study that has been active since 
2009. 1045 participants took part in the first wave of economic game data 
collection, were successfully paid for the study, and did not time out
of their session. In the second wave, this sample size dropped to 631 
(60% retention rate). Comparisons of drop-outs and non-drop-outs suggested that 
retention did not systematically bias our sample (see Supplementary Table 
\@ref(tab:biasTable)). We only analysed data from participants who completed 
both waves (n = `r nrow(d)`; 
`r printnum(sum(d$Gender.T10 == 0, na.rm = T))` females; mean age = 
`r printnum(mean(d$Age.T10, na.rm = T), digits = 0)` years; age range = 
`r printnum(min(d$Age.T10, na.rm = T), digits = 0)` - 
`r printnum(max(d$Age.T10, na.rm = T), digits = 0)` years). This sample size was 
the largest available to us and was not determined through a formal power 
analysis. These data are the same as used in our previous work
[@Claessens2022; @Claessens2023].

## Materials

### Self-report measures

Main self-report measures were taken from Waves 10 and 11 of the NZAVS. The 
primary measures of interest for this study were: Social Dominance Orientation 
[@Pratto1994]; support for income redistribution ("redistributing money and 
wealth more evenly among a larger percentage of the people in New Zealand 
through heavy taxes on the rich"); income attribution ("if incomes were more 
equal, people would be less motivated to work hard"); and support for New 
Zealand's centre-right National Party. We chose these measures because they all 
exhibited cross-sectional correlations with the cooperative phenotype in 
previous research [@Claessens2023].

Other time-invariant covariates that could plausibly act as confounding 
variables were taken from Wave 10 of the NZAVS. These included socio-demographic
variables (age, gender, ethnicity, education, measures of local deprivation, 
socio-economic status, and religiosity), personality variables (extraversion, 
agreeableness, conscientiousness, neuroticism, openness-to-experience, 
honesty-humility, and narcissism) [@Sibley2011] and Right Wing Authoritarianism 
[@Altemeyer1981]. We do not include RWA as a primary measure of interest in this
study because our previous work found no cross-sectional association between RWA
and the cooperative phenotype [@Claessens2023]. See Supplementary Table 
\@ref(tab:itemTable) for the full list of self-report items.

### Battery of economic games

Participants completed three incentivised one-shot economic games, conducted 
online in real-time using oTree software [@Chen2016]. These games measure 
cooperative behaviour and are largely identical to the cooperation games used in
@Peysakhovich2014. We used the strategy method to elicit responses in all roles.
Participants played for points, which were converted to New Zealand dollars 
(1 point = $0.035).

The three cooperation games are as follows:

- _Dictator Game_. Player A is given 100 points. They must decide how many of 
  these points to transfer to Player B. Player A keeps the remaining points.
  Player B is passive in the interaction.
- _Trust Game_. Players A and B both start with 50 points. First, Player A 
  decides whether or not to transfer all 50 points to Player B, in the 
  knowledge that the transferred amount will be tripled to 150 points. If 
  Player A transfers, Player B now has 200 points. Player B must then decide to 
  transfer 0 - 150 points back to Player A. There are thus two decisions in 
  this game: giving and returning.
- _Public Goods Game_. Four players begin with 100 points each. They can 
  contribute 0 - 100 points into a shared group project. All four decisions are 
  made simultaneously, and then the amount in the group project is doubled and 
  distributed evenly between all four players. Each player ends the game with 
  their share from the group project, plus the points they initially refrained 
  from contributing.

In both waves, participants also completed additional punishment games 
(Ultimatum Game, Third Party Punishment Game, and Second Party Punishment Game).
Moreover, in the first wave, participants completed additional coordination 
games (Stag Hunt Game and Stag Hunt Game with Punishment) and, in the second 
wave, participants completed additional behavioural measures of rule following 
and social information use [@Claessens2023]. We only used the Dictator Game, 
Trust Game, and Public Goods Game to estimate the cooperative phenotype to be 
consistent with prior research [@Peysakhovich2014] and because these are the 
only games where there is no possibility of prosocial behaviour being driven by 
the threat of potential punishment of selfishness.

To determine whether learning occurred between waves and affected subsequent 
game behaviour, we estimated differences in behaviour between the two waves (see
Supplementary Table \@ref(tab:diffTable)). For the Public Goods Game and the 
Trust Game, we found no differences in game behaviour between waves. In the 
Dictator Game, participants gave slightly less in the second wave, but this 
difference was small (2 fewer points given, on average, out of 100). These 
results suggest that learning biases are not a major concern in our study.

## Procedure

The NZAVS collects self-report data both online and via paper surveys. In Wave 
10 of the study, most of the data were collected between November 2018 and 
September 2019, and in Wave 11 of the study, most of the data were collected 
between October 2019 and November 2020 (see Supplementary Figure 
\@ref(fig:timelinePlot) for timeline).

Data collection for the first wave of economic games was conducted between 
18^th^ February and 25^th^ July 2019, and data collection for the second wave 
was conducted between 19^th^ October and 11^th^ November 2020. Sessions were 
conducted in real-time on midweek evenings, during which the economic games were
completed in a randomised order. Participants did not receive any information 
about their earnings over the course of the session to avoid any potential 
wealth or learning effects between games. See Supplementary Methods for further
procedural details.

After the sessions, participants were randomly matched into groups to determine 
bonus payments. After being matched, participants were informed about their 
outcomes in each of the economic games. Participants were paid a \$20 NZD 
show-up fee, plus their bonus payment. In the first wave, participants earned a 
bonus payment of \$`r printnum(mean(d$egame.Paid.T10 - 20))` on average (SD = 
\$`r printnum(sd(d$egame.Paid.T10 - 20))`). In the second wave, participants 
earned a bonus payment of \$`r printnum(mean(d$egame.Paid.T11 - 20))` on 
average (SD = \$`r printnum(sd(d$egame.Paid.T11 - 20))`).

## Pre-registration

We pre-registered our hypotheses on the Open Science Framework 
(https://osf.io/ksw3x/?view_only=597d9d552bc142f4a6d59e4eba97b425) before 
running the second wave of economic game data collection. First, we 
hypothesised that the cooperation games in the second wave would all load onto 
a single latent variable, replicating our previous work [@Claessens2023]. 
Second, we hypothesised that this "cooperative phenotype" would be negatively 
related to SDO within the second wave, again replicating our previous work. 
Third, we hypothesised that the cooperative phenotype latent variable would 
have at least scalar measurement invariance across waves [@Carlsson2014; 
@Peysakhovich2014]. Fourth, we predicted that our longitudinal models would 
provide support for at least one of the causal models visualised in Figure 
\@ref(fig:theoreticalModels).

We deviated from our pre-registration in our interpretation of a lack of 
cross-lagged effects. In the pre-registration, we stated that a lack of 
cross-lagged effects, along with the presence of within-wave correlations, would
support the common-cause model in Figure \@ref(fig:theoreticalModels). However,
an anonymous reviewer pointed out that this is not necessarily true, especially
if potential common causes are not statistically controlled for. We no longer 
make this statistical inference, but test several versions of the common cause 
model by systematically controlling for a range of potential confounds, 
including demographic and personality variables.

## Statistical analysis

We used confirmatory factor analysis and structural equation modelling to test 
our pre-registered hypotheses. For measurement invariance analyses, we fitted a 
confirmatory factor analysis model with correlated item errors across waves to 
deal with non-independence of observations. For our longitudinal modelling, we 
used two-wave two-variable cross-lagged panel models.

```{r}
propComplete <- 
  (dplyr::select(d, Age.T10, Gender.T10, EthnicCats.T10, NZREG.T10, 
                 NZSEI13.T10, NZDep.2013.T10, Religious.T10, T10.RWA, 
                 T10.SDO, T11.SDO, Issue.IncomeRedistribution.T10, 
                 Issue.IncomeRedistribution.T11, IncomeAttribution.T10, 
                 IncomeAttribution.T11, Pol.SupNational.T10, Pol.SupNational.T11, 
                 egame.TG1.T10, egame.TG1.T11, egame.TG2.T10, egame.TG2.T11, 
                 egame.PGG.T10, egame.PGG.T11, egame.DG.T10, egame.DG.T11) %>% 
     drop_na() %>% 
     nrow()
   ) / nrow(d)
```

`r printnum(propComplete * 100, digits = 0)`% of participants had complete data
for all variables (see Supplementary Figure \@ref(fig:plotObs)). To deal with 
missing data, we used multiple imputation with predictive mean matching 
[@R-mice]. Multiple imputation procedures generate a number of plausible 
complete datasets with imputed missing values. Statistical models are then
fitted to all imputed datasets and results are pooled across models to account
for uncertainty in imputed values. We followed the advice of imputing at least
as many datasets as the percentage of cases that are incomplete 
[@vonHippel2009]. We therefore pooled our estimates across 20 imputed datasets. 
Visual inspection confirmed the plausibility of imputed values (see 
Supplementary Figure \@ref(fig:impPlot)). Results for all models were 
unchanged when using listwise deletion (see Supplementary Material).

## Transparency and openness

Since the NZAVS is an ongoing longitudinal study, ethical concerns prevent us 
from making the dataset from this study (including the main survey data and the 
economic game data) publicly available. However, data are available on request 
from the lead author.

Pre-registration, analysis plan, R code for analyses, and Python code for the 
economic games are available at 
https://osf.io/ksw3x/?view_only=597d9d552bc142f4a6d59e4eba97b425. All analyses 
were conducted in R version 4.2.1 [@R-base] using the _lavaan_ package 
[@R-lavaan]. Figures were created using _ggraph_ [@R-ggraph], _cowplot_ 
[@R-cowplot], and _ggplot2_ [@R-ggplot2] packages, multiple imputation was 
implemented using the _mice_ package [@R-mice], reproducibility of all analyses 
was ensured by using the _targets_ package [@R-targets], and the manuscript was 
generated using the _papaja_ package [@R-papaja].

# Results

```{r echo=F, message=F, warning=F, results="hide"}
tar_load(cfa1)
tar_load(sem1)
s <- data.frame(summary(sem1, ci = TRUE))
```

In the first step of our pre-registered analyses, we focused on the 
second wave of data in order to replicate our previous findings from the first 
wave [@Claessens2023]. First, we fitted a confirmatory factor analysis model 
with the Trust Game (Give), Trust Game (Return), Dictator Game, and Public 
Goods Game loading onto a "cooperative phenotype" latent variable. Supporting 
our first pre-registered hypothesis, all factor loadings were significantly 
positive (_p_ < 0.05) and the model fitted the data well (CFI = 
`r printnum(as.numeric(fitMeasures(cfa1)['cfi']))`, RMSEA = 
`r printnum(as.numeric(fitMeasures(cfa1)['rmsea']))`, SRMR = 
`r printnum(as.numeric(fitMeasures(cfa1)['srmr']))`; Supplementary Figure 
\@ref(fig:cfa1Plot)) [@Hu1999; @MacCallum1996]. The games showed acceptable 
reliability in both the first wave ($\alpha$ = 
`r printnum(tar_read(reliability1)$alpha)`, $\omega$ = 
`r printnum(tar_read(reliability1)$omega.tot)`) and the second wave ($\alpha$ =
`r printnum(tar_read(reliability2)$alpha)`, $\omega$ = 
`r printnum(tar_read(reliability2)$omega.tot)`), and the zero-order correlations
between games were all positive and small-to-medium in size (_r_ = 0.20 -- 0.37;
Supplementary Figure \@ref(fig:plotCors)) supporting the existence of a single 
latent construct.

Second, we fitted a structural equation model with SDO as the sole predictor of 
the cooperative phenotype latent variable. Supporting our second pre-registered 
hypothesis, we found that SDO significantly negatively predicted the cooperative 
phenotype (unstandardised _b_ = `r printnum(s[5,5])`, 95% confidence interval 
[`r printnum(s[5,10])` `r printnum(s[5,11])`], _p_ `r printp(s[5,9])`; 
Supplementary Figure \@ref(fig:sem1Plot)). Together, these findings replicate 
our previous work with the same sample of participants eighteen months later 
[@Claessens2023].

```{r echo=F, message=F, warning=F, results="hide"}
tar_load(configMI)
tar_load(metricMI)
tar_load(scalarMI)
tar_load(strictMI)
```

In the next step of our pre-registered analyses, we tested the measurement 
invariance of the cooperative phenotype latent variable across the two waves. 
Longitudinal measurement invariance testing ensures that latent factor 
structures are stable over time, an important prerequisite to cross-lagged 
panel modelling. We found support for strict invariance of the cooperative
phenotype latent variable over time (see Supplementary Results) suggesting that 
the cooperative phenotype was measured with the same reliability over an
eighteen-month period. Moreover, the between-wave latent correlation from the 
strict invariance model (_r_ = 
`r printnum(standardizedSolution(strictMI)[9,"est.std"])`, 95% CI
[`r printnum(standardizedSolution(strictMI)[9,"ci.lower"])`
`r printnum(standardizedSolution(strictMI)[9,"ci.upper"])`]) suggested that the 
cooperative phenotype exhibited good test-retest reliability over time.

```{r echo=F, warning=F, message=F, results='hide'}
tar_load(clpm1.01a)
s <- as.data.frame(summary(clpm1.01a, ci = TRUE))
```

We then proceeded to fit our pre-registered two-variable two-wave cross-lagged 
panel models. We first fitted our primary cross-lagged panel model, modelling 
the relationship between SDO and the cooperative phenotype over time (Figure 
\@ref(fig:clpmPlotASDO)a; Supplementary Figure \@ref(fig:clpmPlotBSDO)a). We 
found significantly positive autoregressive effects: SDO in the first wave 
predicted SDO in the second wave (standardised 
$\beta$ = `r printnum(standardizedSolution(clpm1.01a)[34,5])`, unstandardised 
_b_ = `r printnum(s[34,5])`, 95% CI [`r printnum(s[34,10])` 
`r printnum(s[34,11])`], _p_ `r printp(s[34,9])`) and the cooperative phenotype 
in the first wave predicted the cooperative phenotype in the second wave 
($\beta$ = `r printnum(standardizedSolution(clpm1.01a)[31,5])`, _b_ = 
`r printnum(s[31,5])`, 95% CI [`r printnum(s[31,10])` `r printnum(s[31,11])`], 
_p_ `r printp(s[31,9])`). Additionally, we found that the cooperative phenotype 
in the first wave negatively predicted SDO in the second wave ($\beta$ = 
`r printnum(standardizedSolution(clpm1.01a)[33,5])`, _b_ = 
`r printnum(s[33,5])`, 95% CI [`r printnum(s[33,10])` `r printnum(s[33,11])`], 
_p_ = `r printp(s[33,9])`), but SDO in the first wave did not predict the 
cooperative phenotype in the second wave ($\beta$ 
= `r printnum(standardizedSolution(clpm1.01a)[32,5])`, _b_ = 
`r printnum(s[32,5])`, 95% CI [`r printnum(s[32,10])` `r printnum(s[32,11])`], 
_p_ = `r printp(s[32,9])`). These cross-lagged paths were significantly 
different from one another (difference in unstandardised estimates = 
`r printnum(s[47,5])`, 95% CI [`r printnum(s[47,10])` `r printnum(s[47,11])`], 
_p_ = `r printp(s[47,9])`). According to established benchmarks for cross-lagged
effect sizes, the cross-lagged effect of the cooperative phenotype on future SDO
is a medium-to-large effect size [@Orth2022].

```{r echo=F, warning=F, message=F, results='hide'}
tar_load(clpm1_gender)
tar_load(clpm1_ethnic)
s1 <- as.data.frame(summary(clpm1_gender, ci = TRUE))
s2 <- as.data.frame(summary(clpm1_ethnic, ci = TRUE))
```

To test possible common-cause explanations for this pattern of results,
we ran additional cross-lagged panel models controlling for a range of 
time-invariant covariates that could plausibly act as confounds (Figures 
\@ref(fig:clpmPlotASDO)b and \@ref(fig:clpmPlotASDO)c; Supplementary Figures 
\@ref(fig:clpmPlotBSDO)b and \@ref(fig:clpmPlotBSDO)c). The cross-lagged path 
from the cooperative phenotype to later SDO remained significantly negative when
controlling for most demographic and personality variables, but was attenuated
when controlling for gender and ethnicity. Given these results, we ran 
exploratory multi-group cross-lagged panel models with separate groups for (1) 
male and female participants, and (2) participants of European ancestry and 
participants not of European ancestry (due to small sample sizes in individual
Asian, Māori, and Pacific groups). These follow-up models revealed that the
cross-lagged path from the cooperative phenotype to later SDO was significantly
negative for males ($\beta$ = 
`r printnum(standardizedSolution(clpm1_gender)[79,6])`, _b_ = 
`r printnum(s1[79,7])`, 95% CI [`r printnum(s1[79,12])` 
`r printnum(s1[79,13])`], _p_ = `r printp(s1[79,11])`) but not for females 
($\beta$ = `r printnum(standardizedSolution(clpm1_gender)[33,6])`, _b_ = 
`r printnum(s1[33,7])`, 95% CI [`r printnum(s1[33,12])` 
`r printnum(s1[33,13])`], _p_ = `r printp(s1[33,11])`) though these were both 
in the same direction. Similarly, the cross-lagged path from the cooperative 
phenotype to later SDO was significantly negative for participants of European 
ancestry ($\beta$ = `r printnum(standardizedSolution(clpm1_ethnic)[79,6])`, 
_b_ = `r printnum(s2[79,7])`, 95% CI [`r printnum(s2[79,12])` 
`r printnum(s2[79,13])`], _p_ = `r printp(s2[79,11])`) but not for other 
participants ($\beta$ = `r printnum(standardizedSolution(clpm1_ethnic)[33,6])`, 
_b_ = `r printnum(s2[33,7])`, 95% CI [`r printnum(s2[33,12])` 
`r printnum(s2[33,13])`], _p_ = `r printp(s2[33,11])`) though these were both 
in the same direction.

We also collected data on other self-reported measures of political views, 
including views on income redistribution, income attribution, and support for 
the centre-right National Party. To assess the generalisability of our results, 
we swapped out SDO in our cross-lagged panel model for these additional 
measures.

When we included support for income redistribution in the model instead of SDO, 
we found a similar pattern of results: the cooperative phenotype positively 
predicted future support for income redistribution with a small-to-medium effect 
size, but support for income redistribution did not predict future cooperation 
(Supplementary Figures \@ref(fig:clpmPlotAIncRed) and \@ref(fig:clpmPlotBIncRed)).
However, this pattern of results was attenuated when controlling for gender, 
ethnicity, religiosity, agreeableness, openness-to-experience, and 
honesty-humility. When we included income attribution views and support for New 
Zealand's centre-right National Party in the model instead of SDO, we found no 
cross-lagged effects over time (Supplementary Figures \@ref(fig:clpmPlotAIncAtt) 
-- \@ref(fig:clpmPlotBPolNat)).

# Discussion

In a cross-lagged longitudinal analysis of cooperative behaviour and 
self-reported political attitudes, we have shown that the cooperative phenotype 
predicts SDO a year and a half later, but SDO does not predict future variation 
in the cooperative phenotype. This result is in line with the 
cooperation-as-antecedent model (Figure \@ref(fig:theoreticalModels)) which 
posits that general behavioural predispositions like the cooperative phenotype 
causally influence political views, but not vice versa. This causal model 
explains previously reported negative cross-sectional correlations between 
cooperation and SDO [@Haesevoets2015; @Haesevoets2018; @Halali2018; 
@Thielmann2020; @Claessens2023] as arising from a causal relationship from 
behavioural preferences to political views.

```{r echo=FALSE}
# calculate difference in SDO
d$SDOdiff <- d$T10.SDO - d$T11.SDO
# two groups
d$group <- ifelse(
  as.character(d$EthnicCats.T10) == "Pakeha" & d$Gender.T10 == 1, 
  "Pakeha males", "Others"
  )
d$group <- ifelse(!is.na(d$group), d$group, "Others")
# variance in sdo difference
varPakehaMales <- var(d$SDOdiff[d$group == "Pakeha males"], na.rm = TRUE)
varOthers <- var(d$SDOdiff[d$group == "Others"], na.rm = TRUE)
# levene's test
levene <- leveneTest(SDOdiff ~ factor(group), data = d)
```

Additionally, the cross-lagged path from cooperation to future SDO was robust 
to a wide range of time-invariant demographic and personality covariates. It is 
therefore unlikely that these variables are acting as common causes and 
generating the observed pattern of relationships (though, of course, it remains
possible that other unmodelled common causes could exist). However, the 
cross-lagged path from cooperation to future SDO was attenuated when controlling
for gender and ethnicity. In particular, exploratory analyses revealed that the
cross-lagged effect held only for male participants of European ancestry. This
is similar to the finding that upper body strength is related to support for
inequality in males, but not females [@Petersen2019]. A possible evolutionary
explanation for this effect of gender might be that humans have large sexual
dimorphism in strength and formidability and, therefore, a correlation between
the cooperative phenotype and dominative/competitive tactics for resource
distribution is more likely among males. But this does not explain the effect of
ethnicity. Perhaps a simpler explanation is that SDO is generally higher among
males and people from dominant ethnic groups [@Pratto1994; @Sidanius2000]. Among
these participants, there is potentially more room for a change in SDO over 
time, whereas female participants from minority ethnic groups may have already
hit the floor of the scale and therefore have less room for change. In line with
this explanation, when we look at the differences in SDO between the two waves,
we find that these difference scores have a higher variance for males of 
European ancestry (variance = `r round(varPakehaMales, 2)`) compared to other 
participants (variance = `r round(varOthers, 2)`; Levene's test, 
_F_(`r levene$Df[1]`,`r levene$Df[2]`) = `r printnum(levene[["F value"]][1])`, 
_p_ `r printp(levene[["Pr(>F)"]][1])`) suggesting that SDO had more room for 
change over time among males of European ancestry. Future research should 
disentangle the roles of gender and ethnicity in the causal relationship 
between behavioural predispositions and political views.

When we generalised our cross-lagged analysis to other political views, we found 
more mixed results. As expected, the cooperative phenotype positively predicted 
future support for income redistribution, but cooperation was not longitudinally 
related to support for the centre-right National Party, nor was it 
longitudinally related to income attribution beliefs. These null results could 
arise from a shared cause influencing these variables at the same time (i.e., 
the common-cause model in Figure \@ref(fig:theoreticalModels)) creating a 
cross-sectional relationship but no longitudinal effects. However, this pattern 
of null results is also consistent with other explanations. For example, it may 
be that party affiliation and income attribution beliefs are simply less 
amenable to change over time: people rarely shift their political party 
affiliation [@PewResearchCenter2020] and income attribution beliefs have been 
characterised as a stable individual difference [@Osborne2015; but see 
@Piff2020]. Alternatively, cross-lagged effects may exist between the 
cooperative phenotype and these variables but on longer or shorter timescales 
than studied here. It is therefore difficult to interpret these null results 
as supporting any particular causal model from Figure 
\@ref(fig:theoreticalModels).

Nevertheless, our results for SDO and views on income redistribution are broadly
consistent with the dual evolutionary foundations framework for political 
ideology. The cross-lagged effects of the cooperative phenotype on these 
variables support either the cooperation-as-antecedent or common cause model, 
and none of our results directly support the causal model that is inconsistent 
with the dual evolutionary foundations (the cooperation-as-outcome model). 
Moreover, our measurement invariance analyses and the latent correlation from 
our strict invariance model revealed that the cooperative phenotype latent 
variable had adequate test-retest reliability over eighteen months, supporting 
another central claim from the dual evolutionary foundations framework that the 
general social drives that partly shape political ideology should be relatively 
stable over time. This finding expands on studies showing that cooperative 
behaviour in individual economic games positively covaries when measured over 
four months [@Peysakhovich2014; @Reigstad2017], one year [@Lonnqvist2015], and 
even six years [@Carlsson2014].

One important limitation of this study is our use of two-wave cross-lagged 
panel models to determine longitudinal effects. Cross-lagged panel models have 
been criticised for not correctly partitioning within-person change from stable 
between-person differences [@Hamaker2015]. As an alternative to the 
cross-lagged panel model, @Hamaker2015 proposed the random-intercept 
cross-lagged panel model, which estimates a random intercept to capture stable 
individual differences over time. Unfortunately, random-intercept cross-lagged
panel models require at least three waves of data to be identified
[@Hamaker2015] and so we were limited by our two waves of data in this study.
Moving forward, it will be vital to extend this study to include additional 
waves of behavioural and self-report data to determine if our results hold when
accounting for stable between-person differences.

Future research should expand our multi-wave behavioural and self-report 
approach to include additional measures. In particular, to provide a complete 
picture for the dual evolutionary foundations framework, future research should 
test whether group conformist predispositions predict future variation in RWA 
and social policy views. Evidence already suggests that RWA covaries 
cross-sectionally with conformist behaviour in the rule following task and 
social learning tasks [@Fischer2021; @Claessens2023]. Extending this research 
longitudinally will allow researchers to make stronger causal inferences than 
are possible on the basis of cross-sectional data alone. We hope that future 
work will continue to unpack the causal pathways underlying the psychological 
causes and consequences of political ideology.
